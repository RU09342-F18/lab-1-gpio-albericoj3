# Multiple Blink
The purpose of this code is to blink two different LEDs at different frequencies. The red LED blinks every x clock cycles and the green LED blinks every x clock cycles. The program will start once it has been uploaded to the microprocessor.

## MSP430G2553
The pins for the MSP430G22553 include:
* Red LED: 
* Green LED:

## Other board
The pins for the x include:
* Red LED:
* Green LED:

## Implementation
To implement this code, upload the code to the microprocessor and connect the LEDs to the correct ports. This only needs to be done is the user isn't using the LEDs included on the development board.

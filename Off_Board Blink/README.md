# Off Board Blink
The purpose of this code is to blink two different LEDs at different frequencies on a breadboard. The red LED blinks every 2 clock cycles and the green LED blinks every 12 clock cycles. The program will start once it has been uploaded to the microprocessor. The microprocessor has been removed and placed onto the breadboard. The pinout below is how the processor was wired.

Connect the correct pinouts to the microprocessor as stated below:

Pin 1: DVCC

Pin 2: 1.0 (Red LED)

Pin 16: RST (RC circuit used to resist noise)

Pin 14: 1.6 (Green LED)


## MSP430G2553
The pins for the MSP430G22553 include:
* Red LED: 1.0
* Green LED: 1.6


## Implementation
To implement the code, upload it to the processor. Remove the processor from the board then connect the proper components to it on a breadboard.

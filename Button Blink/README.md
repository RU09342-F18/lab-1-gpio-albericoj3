# Button Blink
The purpose of this program is to blink an LED only if the button on the development board is held down. This program uses the LED and button found on the development board. The button is configured as a continuous press. The user will have to hold the button down to blink the LED. The button is normally open, so once the user lets go of the button it will open the circuit and prevent the signa from getting to the board.
